## 🔑 A Note on Credentials

This repository contains test credentials, such as those found in the Spring Boot configuration files or the Docker Compose file. **Please note**: this is an intentional bad practice, used here solely for development and testing purposes in a controlled, containerized environment.

No sensitive or production data is processed in this project, and these credentials are not intended for use in any production setting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always follow secure credential management practices, such as using environment variables or secret management tools, when developing production-grade applications.
